x86-info-term
===
x86-info-term is a curses-based viewer for x86 instruction info built with
Python 3. It combines the following data sources:
* Intrinsics from the [Intel Intrinsics Guide](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/).
* Performance info from [uops.info](https://uops.info).

Features
===

* **Offline use:** after the data sources are downloaded on the first run, requires no
network access to run
* **More advanced filtering:** multiple filters are allowed, and so is filtering by
regular expression (using [Python's regex syntax](
https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax)). Filter terms
can be prefixed by `!` to negate the filter meaning. For example, the filter `avx-512 !_mask`
will show all AVX-512 operations but filter out the masking variants.
* **Keyboard-only navigation:** using a combination of vim- and emacs-style key bindings,
x86-info-term is sure to delight and/or annoy everyone.
* **100% Pretty Cool**

Key bindings
===

**Data sources**

* `s`: switch main data source view (toggling between Intel intrinsics data or uops.info instructions)

**Scrolling**

* `<count>`: a number can be prefixed to any vertical scroll to multiply the movement, like in vim.
* `Ctrl-Y`: one line up
* `Ctrl-E`: one line down
* `Ctrl-U`: one half-page up
* `Ctrl-D`: one half-page down
* `Page Up`: one page up
* `Page Down`: one page down (who would've thought?)
* `h`, `Left`: scroll tables left (right now, just the performance data from uops.info)
* `l`, `Right`: scroll tables right

**Cursor movement**

*This is for the intrinsic-selection cursor, not for text editing: see "Filtering" below for that*
* `<count>`: a number can be prefixed to any movement to multiply the movement, like in vim. For example,
`33j` moves 33 rows down, and `33J` moves 330 rows down. A count used with the `g`/`G` commands moves to
an absolute line number.
* `j`, `Down`: one row down
* `k`, `Up`: one row up
* `J`: ten rows down
* `K`: ten rows up
* `u`: one half-page up
* `d`: one half-page down
* `g`, `Home`: first row
* `G`, `End`: last row

**Detail view**

*Each intrinsic can be expanded/collapsed to show/hide complete data*
* `Space`, `Enter`: toggle open/close of selected row
* `o`: open selected row
* `c`: close selected row
* `O`: open all rows
* `C`: close all rows

**Filtering**

* `f`, `/`, `Tab`: from the normal browsing mode, start entering a filter
* most normal keys, arrow keys, delete/backspace, etc.: edit the filter with usual key meanings
* `Enter`, `Tab`: keep filter, return to browsing mode
* `Esc`: remove current filter and return to browsing mode
* `Ctrl-F`: move cursor forward one character
* `Ctrl-B`: move cursor back one character
* `Ctrl-W`: delete word before cursor
* `Ctrl-U`: delete line before cursor
* `Ctrl-K`: delete line after cursor
